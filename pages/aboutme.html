                My name is Sean Raymond. I’m an aspiring programmer and a nerd.

                    <h2>My Personality</h2>
                    <p>
                        I really enjoy learning programming languages like Javascript, CSS, and HTML5. I am taking the Web Application Design class at CART in Clovis, California, where I live, and I really enjoy it. It is a mix between having fun learning new things, and trying those new things, as well as getting work done in a job environment style. It takes a lot of time and dedication to get the assignments from this class done on time because it is making websites, but the work is also the fun part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't wait to get a job in a programming related field. It has been a dream of mine to achieve a high position in one of these styles of jobs, and even begin my own company. I would love to spend my life programming and learning new languages as they come out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I consider myself a very creative person. As a kid I really enjoyed playing with toys and seeing where my imagination took me. I would get distracted as I let my creativity take me to fun places. Now I use that creativity for things such as this website.

                    <h2>My Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        My friend Nathaniel Barragan and I worked on a project making a website about an endangered species. We chose to do siberian tigers as our animal. During this project, we disputed over many styling choices, but in the end we are very proud of what we made. See <a href="web-projects.html">Web Projects - S.R Portfolio</a>

                    <p>
                        We are currently in the midst of making a text adventure game. It is possibly going to be based somewhat off of the Eyes of the Lich Queen storyline. Although I am just assisting him as he is the better programmer out of us two, I am still enjoying helping. I am also using this project as a learning experience for learning JavaScript techniques as well as programming techniques.

                    <h2>My Family</h2>
                    <p>
                        I own two dogs and four cats, and I love them all dearly. I really enjoy spending time with my family. I really love watching movies with them and spending time talking to them. My dad and I actually have taken up the hobby of racing RC cars. It’s expensive but it is very fun. The rest of this webpage goes more in depth of my professional profile as well as more about myself. If this interests you, read into the rest of the website.

                    <h2>What I do in My Freetime</h2>
                    <p>
                        I do lots of things in my freetime. I enjoy playing video games. I plan on going into the game design field and creating video games. According to my parents I "spend too much time" playing video games. But I am studying the trends of popular video games and their balancing.I I also draw ideas from these games to implement them into my future games.

                        I also enjoy learning to program. On my github page, linked on my <a href="contact.html">Contact Me - S.R Portfolio</a> page, you can view all of my repositories and try them for yourself.
