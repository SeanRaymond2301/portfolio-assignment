                <h2>This Website</h2>
                <p>Before you look any further into this website, this is a collection of information about myself. It will entail details of my personal life and achievements, as well as academic achievements. It will also provide ways to contact myself, provide
                    my resume, as well as letters of recommendations from two of my teachers. The purpose of this website is to be a representation about everything about me. Everything from the style of the website to the content written within it are all
                    representatives of my artistic style and personality. I really enjoy working on projects such as this where the only limitation is to be myself. Limitations are not a dealbreaker however. I really enjoy working on large projects that
                    challenge me no matter what, whether it is my personal ability limiting me or a limitation set by a client.

                <h2>My Creativity</h2>
                <p>I have always considered myself a very creative person. I try to find new and different ways to solve certain problems. I like to try to find the &quot;lazy&quot; way to do things. But as humans, we like to try to find the easiest way to do
                    something. I strive to do this. Even with this project, the card carousel on the <a href="aboutme.html">About Me - S.R Portfolio</a> page, I spent multiple hours on writing the JavaScript for it to try my best to get it to work. After rewriting it multiple
                    times and condensing it down to a fairly small amount of code compared to what it started as, I am proud of my achievement. I am not proud to say how long it took me to accomplish it, but it is complete and that is all that matters. I in the end found many &quot;lazy&quot; always
                    the carousel to work, but I prefer to think of them as easier ways.</p>

                <h2>My Plan</h2>
                <p>With this website, I intend to portray myself in a professional, yet casual manner. I intend to provide the reader, whomever it may be, with information about my personality, as well as the work I have completed professionally. I hope to inform
                    others about myself such as I have learned about others, as well as inform others of my particular skills. I really enjoy web development, and programming in general. As I state in the <a href="aboutme.html">About Me - S.R Portfolio</a> page, I really
                    hope to get a job in this particular field.</p>

                <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
                <p>This website, as well as informing others on myself and my personality, as well as my artistic style, follows the general goal of many websites: To be enjoyed! This website has been created with many hours of work, racking my brain for solutions
                    to problems I can't seem to solve, to be enjoyed. Being able to create an enjoyable website is my end goal everytime I start a new project such as this. So without further delay, please! Enjoy this website!</p>
