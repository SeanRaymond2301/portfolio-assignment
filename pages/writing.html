            <p>I don't consider myself the greatest writer of all man kind. I do however consider myself a good writer. I have been complimented many times for the essays I write by many teachers in the past. I hope these examples of my writing show I write in a very structured and professional manner.</p>

                    Should Ready Player One, by the author Earnest Cline, be read in high school English classes? This essay will go over different aspects of the books, and the reasons behind why this book should be read. There are multiple themes and aspects that teenagers can relate to about
                    this book. This book is about a teenaged boy, Wade, who is competing in a challenge for
                    ownership of and the riches of the game he loves, the OASIS. There are important aspects
                    that can be learned from his adventures.

                    In English classes, teaching themes of literature is a
                    very important part of English class. The book Ready Player One has many themes, obvious and
                    subtle. The first and most obvious is the dystopian characteristics of the world that the
                    characters live in. As the main protagonist Wade describes his world, “The ongoing energy
                    crisis. Catastrophic climate change. Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a dozen
                    wars. You know: ‘dogs and cats living with each other… mass hysteria!’”(page 1), this brief
                    yet detail ridden description of the Earth in 2044 shows how countries are warring, fighting
                    for energy that is quickly dwindling, and how people are being impoverished by this
                    economic climate. Wade goes as far as to describe the living conditions of the working class,
                    of which he is. As he states, they live in trailer parks with the trailers stacked on each other,
                    called the stacks. (page 21).

                <p style="padding-top: 50px;" class="border">This example is from an essay I wrote in my 11th grade English class at CART. We were tasked to write a persuasive essay arguing whether or not the Book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; should be read in High School English classes. One catch was we were tasked to do so in an hour. I finished the essay within the time limit with a word count of 911.

                <h2>Example 2</h2>
                <p>
                    The introduction the the character, the time period, as well as his conditions of living were very well introduced. My focus has been captured greatly by the development of the character throughout the first three chapters. The development of Wade Watts, or Perzival, is very relatable on many aspects. He is a geeky video game buff who is really into technology. His parents both died at fairly young ages, and he was left to live with his aunt and her boyfriend, as well as two other families in a trailer in a “stack.” Although I can’t relate to it, I can still sympathize with his position. His dad gave him his name, Wade Watts, because it sounds like a secret name like Clark Kent, or it sounds like Peter Parker. He went to school through his 6th grade year and wes extensively bullied. He was overweight at the time and had acne like a teenager. He claims that most if not all of the exercise he received. His school began to offer schooling on a game called OASIS, which is an online virtual reality game. A while ago, in middle school, I watched an anime called SAO, or Sword Art Online, which I could not stop thinking related a lot to this book. He began to attend OPS#1873 on the planet Ludus in the game. Normally, in the game, interplanetary travel, or travel in general, costed credits in game. Wade, not having any credits, did not have to worry about this however, even though his character was on Incipio. The school provided a one way ticket from anywhere in the game to Ludus, the schooling planet. He does all of this in an abandoned van outside of the stacks in a pile he found, still unlocked with the keys. He rigged up an exercise bike with some old car batteries and a space heater to keep it warm, used styrofoam and egg cartons to soundproof it, and hid most of his belongings from his aunt. His aunt took all of his food vouchers, as well as all of his valuables to pay the rent on the trailer. In the beginning, the readers actually witness this when his aunt takes away the laptop he was using to study for the contest. The contest is a part of OASIS that every member was taking part in. It took the world by storm, as most people in the real world used OASIS. Basically, the contest was created by the mastermind behind the game. He was a multi-billionaire worth $250,000,000,000. He was stricken by disease, and in his final moments, he created a video called Anorak’s Invitation, later called Anorak’s Almanac, inviting people to participate. The contest was his will, as stated in the beginning of the video. He overrides any previous wills he may have written in the past, although he was a hermit, and states that whoever wins the challenge gets the company and all of the money. The main protagonist spends, like everyone else in the game, all of his free time studying the creator and his interests. At this point in the book, it is 2045, but when James Donovan Halliday was a teenager, it was the 80’s. He was infatuated with 80’s culture, music, and video games. He based the Easter Egg in the game, the contest, on all of these. However Wade, being poor, could not easily participate in the contest. He could do all of the research he wanted to solve the first riddle, The Copper key awaits explorers, in a tomb filled with horrors, but you have much to learn, if you hope to earn, a place among the high scorers. He, as well as many other gunters as they became to be called (A combination of the words egg hunter), believed that much travel was necessary to find the first key. He could not afford to travel as he was poor. He tagged along with his friend Aech whenever he had the opportunity, but Aech began going to places too hard for Wade to go.

                <p class="border" style="padding-top: 50px;">This is a bit longer of an example. This is on the same subject as the first example. However, there was no specific time limit as to how long we took to write it, so long as it was turned in on time. This writing is a less formal example, as the task was to write our interpretation of events and our feeling on them. I kept it grammatically correct however.
