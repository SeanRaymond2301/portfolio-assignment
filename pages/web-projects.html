            <h2>Digital Ethics Website</h2>
            <p>This website was a class wide project among the students in the 2017-2018 CART Web Application Design class. The entire website was split up into 7 groups. I was placed in a team of three, although the third left halfway into the project. My group had the task of making the Digital Use and Teen Driving section of the website. The only requirements were multiple pages per section, as well as everyone's styling should overall be similar to make the page flow better.</p>
            <p>This website was a challenge to make with two people working on it. Had I done this project now instead, I would've requested a more balanced amount of people per group, as there were 2 groups of 2, a group of 3, 3 groups of four, and a group of five. The groups of four and five seemed to have an easier time with this project and did not have to dedicate a lot of time at home. This disparity in amount of people was further enhanced at my slow work pace &#40;at the time&#41;.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am happy with the work my partner and I got done on this site. It was a challenge as we really didn't set ourselves up well, not making mockups. We made mood-boards, but we didn't outline what the pages would look like, so we just freestyled them. If I were to do this project again I would have prepared us better, and made sure things would've gone a lot smoother.</p>

            <h2>Siberian Tiger Website</h2>
            <p>This project is the Endangered Animal Project. We were placed in teams of two to create a webpage about endangered animals or other environmental issues. The limitations set in place were multi page, one CTA &#40;Call To Action&#41; page, a reference page, and we had to mock up every page and how the pages would flow together in Photoshop. I was placed on a team with Nathaniel Barragan.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately upon making the first mockup of the homepage, we ran into some issues. We could not seem to agree on how to style the homepage. To get around this we decided to split up and create seperate homepages and see who's we liked better. We ended up choosing mine, however his was good too. We both agreed mine, at the time, seemed really clean. It also is a very unique layout, using the head of the tiger as the main focus of the background.</p>
            <p>From that point on, we seemed to agree on everything and how we wanted to style things. There were a few things I wanted, but looking back on it, I prefer them not existing. I am surprised that with just the two of us, we were able to make this website.

            <h2>Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>This example is kind of like a recursive function. I am using this website as an example inside of itself because of how proud of it I am. I have spent a large deal of my personal time finishing this site. I was not required to as this was a class assignment, I could've slacked off and done mediocre work. I put myself into this website and dedicated a lot of myself.</p>
            <p>I am using this website because it shows a lot of my creativity. It looks bland on the surface but it has a lot of hidden creativity. It all comes down to how I solved the problems I set in for myself. Such as the cards on the <a href="contact-me.html">Contact Me - S.R Portfolio</a> page, I gave myself challenges, and found creative ways to solve them.</p>
            <p>I am also proud of my layout. As of the time adding this section to the site, I have a variation between single and double columns, all using flex boxes to make a responsive layout. While I still have media queries to do at this point, it will not require much work. My only problem page will be the contact me page, as the elements are absolute positioned. Other than that, the pages all still look decent without any media queries.</p>
